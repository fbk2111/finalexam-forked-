Overview
This is a simple React-based weather app that allows users to check the weather forecast for a given city. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for the next week, including temperature, humidity, rain, and time. I have collaborated with TAâ€™s and friends, according to the rules, online videos were used.

City Search: Users can type the name of a city into the input box.
Weather Data Display: The app displays the weather forecast for the next week, including temperature, humidity, rain, and time.
Background Change: The app dynamically changes its background based on the time of day in the searched city.
Time of Day Detection: The app determines whether it is day or night in the city based on its timezone.
API Integration: The app makes API requests to OpenWeatherMap to fetch weather data.
